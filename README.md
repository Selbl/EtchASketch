# Etch A Sketch

This little webpage generates a 16x16 grid you can colour by hovering your mouse over each small grid! You can also change the grid size and reset the grid if you would like.

The CSS is a work in progress. This project is a part of The Odin Project's curriculum in Full-stack Development.
